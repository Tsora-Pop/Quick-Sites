# Quick-Sites
## What is Quick-Sites
Quick-Sites.ps1 is a PowerShell script I put together to mimic the function of Startup tabs when you open a browser. Except in this case it is best used in circumstances where you would likely already have the browser running and you have a series of web pages you need to open. 

## Example uses for Quick Sites:
* Multiple System Health Status Reviews
* Emergencies that call for specific pages not comonly open
* Nightly news wrap ups
* And much more!

I made a version of this as not only a learning exercise, but as a QoL improvement for my analysts when reviewing system health status pages. I hope this helps!

## To-Run
1. Download "Quick-Sites.ps1"
2. Change defined domains array values into desired values
3. Right-click
4. Run with PowerShell
5. You may be expected to sign your final version of the file if using in production. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-authenticodesignature?view=powershell-7.2
